Data processing step:
- Check Data Types
- Check for Null Values
- Check for Duplicates
- Check Negative Profit
- Check Discount Column
- Create Clean Date Table
- Created a separate Date Table using DAX instead of using the Order Date column directly. The table includes Year, Month, Quarter, and 
- Year-Month fields and is linked to the Orders table with a one-to-many relationship.
- This allows proper time analysis (e.g., Month-over-Month growth), ensures continuous date tracking, and follows star schema.
